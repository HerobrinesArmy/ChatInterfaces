I did commit a file, it was using Java's URL libraries. After much 
googling the consensus (lol) on stackoverflow was that these libraries 
are pretty rubbish. They we recommending an Apache library as a good 
alternative but I have little desire to use these.

I have decided to start from the ground up making my own HTTP client 
libraries with the help of the Java socket libraries.
