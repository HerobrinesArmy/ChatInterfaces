Phoenix's Java Client
==================

You will find the java source code for both the CLI client and GUI client here. I have also included the jar executables in /bin. Since the GUI was my ultimate goal, I will not be supporting the CLI client anymore. You are welcome to fork it, edit it, do what you want with it! However, I would like to focus on the GUI, and thusly, will not be answering anymore questions to do with it.

Both need to be launched (as of writing) from the terminal, passing your username and password as parameters.

## v1.0
Very limited functionality:
* Receives chat message and is able to post to chat
* Requires to be run with a terminal passing username and password as arguments
