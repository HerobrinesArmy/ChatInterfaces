Please do not modify the script in this repo directly, fork it instead. Basically, if you mess up my working copy I will have to kill you.

This script is designed to post in the Herobrine's Army chat room. Typing plain text into the terminal will just send a message.
You can now safely use ctrl + c to exit (though the /exit command is still the best way, because it is tradition).

Arguments
-p <proxy>                        #This sets a proxy, you want to specify it in the form <protocol>://<addresss>:<port>

Commands:

/wolf                             #This posts a single randomly selected wolf
/wolf <number>                    #This posts the wolf with the given number
/wolf count                       #This tells you the number of available wolves
/wolf previous                    #This tells you the number of the last wolf you posted
/cmd <command goes here>          #This runs console commands from within the chat client
/no                               #This posts a large NO in chat, good for telling people they have bad ideas
/ping                             #This pings herobrinesarmy.com and can return either "PONG!" or "FAILURE!"
/logout                           #This logs you out and exits
/exit                             #This exits the program making no attempt to log you out.

/pastebin                         #This posts the content of your clipboard on pastebin and posts a link in chat
/pastebin <file>                  #This posts a file to pastebin and posts a link in chat
